       <h2>The Hampton Legion from South Carolina to California</h2>
       <p> Our unit was formed in 1974 by a young man wanting to reenact as a member of his ancestor's South Carolina regiment. <strong>The Hampton Legion, Co. G, The Claremont Rifles</strong>. We have members who have been with us since the late 1980's, and we are always eager to have new people join our ranks. </p>
       
       <h2>Who Are Reenactors</h2>
       <p>While military reenacting is popular in many countries and covering many wars, Civil War Reenacting has been a growing hobby since it began in the 1960’s spurred on by the Centennial. The 125th anniversary of the start of the war in 1986 saw reenacting turn into a serious hobby. A love of history, a desire to better understand what Civil War era soldiers and civilians experienced, the pleasure of camping with friends and cooking over an open fire all explain why reenactors follow this hobby. </p>
        <p>Reenacting units are organized in companies and regiments by reenactors from the same geographic area, much as Civil War companies and regiments were organized. New reenactors start as privates and promotion to non commissioned officer or officer status depends on passing tests and demonstrating an ability to command larger bodies of men in maneuvers on the field. Reenacting gear includes the uniform, accoutrements, a musket, shoes, hat and more, all purchased from sutlers, merchants specializing in reproduction products for reenactors. Muskets are real guns and fire a full powder charge but no bullet. The basic costs of outfitting an infantryman <em>are between $1,500 and $2,000 </em> which rises to $2,500 to $3,000 with the purchase of tents, ponchos, cooking gear, overcoats and other additional gear. </p>
        <p>Most reenacting units are equipped to act as either Federal or Confederate troops in order to be able to balance numbers at reenacting events. There are three types of reenactors; mainstreamers who do not fit the Civil War image of young thin soldiers and bring extra gear for comfort, campaigners who pride themselves in living rough in the open and achieving authenticity and stitch counters who pay attention to details of the history of uniforms and equipment and who generally maneuver with either mainstreamers or campaigners. </p>
        <p>Reenacting events come in varying categories. Mega events involve thousands of reenactors. The largest event was the <a href="https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?q=135+gettyburg+reenactment&mid=6A408DF8DD7AF7EDC0246A408DF8DD7AF7EDC024&FORM=VIRE" target="_blank">135th Gettysburg reenactment </a> which involved 15,000 reenactors. Invitation events are smaller with limited numbers of participants making them easier to manage. Immersion events are small reenactments where reenactors carry everything with them with no resupply from vehicles. Focused events try to recreate parts of battles. Living histories take place at the actual battlefield by invitation from the National Park Service. The hobby of Civil War reenacting continues to attract participants and spectators who care about Civil War history and the 19th century people who lived it.</p>

       <h2>Reenacting Today</h2>
       <p>In the 1880s and early 20th century, reunions of Civil War military units were popular and often included reenactments. Some were held on Civil War battlefields. These events often were part of larger community holiday celebrations where aging Civil War veterans in uniforms and medals were honored. As they died off in the 1950s, younger people began to don replica uniforms to keep the tradition going. </p>
       <p>Modern large-scale reenactments took off during the 1961 Civil War Centennial and the hobby grew, reaching a peak in the 1990s partly because Ken Burns’ documentary “Civil War” got 139 million viewers, James McPherson’s 1998 book, “The Battle Cry of Freedom,” spent months on the best-seller lists and films included reenactors as extras. </p>
       <p>Reenacting hit a high in the 1990s and 2000s, at the same time that an interest in family history burgeoned with access to historical records on the Internet. Many people who found on-line records documenting their ancestors’ involvement in the Civil War became involved in reenactment and joined Confederate or Union reenactment units.</p>
       <p>Civil War reenactments and other events have declined in popularity during the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement. The National Park Service’s five major Civil War battlefield parks — Gettysburg, Antietam, Shiloh, Chickamauga/Chattanooga, and Vicksburg —had a combined 1.8 million visitors in 2020, down from about 3.1 million in 2018 and 10.2 million in 1970. Gettysburg’s visitor numbers were down 92 percent from 1970. This year, more than 6,000 people participated in the annual battle reenactment at Gettysburg compared to a 1998 high of an estimated 30,000 re-enactors and 50,000 spectators. </p>
       
       <p> Some reenactors have been turned off as other reenactors have protested at events at which Confederate monuments and symbols are being removed and as neo-Nazis have connected their activities with the Confederacy. </p>

       <p>Some Union reenactors say they resent the bad image that the Confederate flag has given to their own reenactment efforts to honor their Union ancestors who fought to preserve the Union and end slavery. </p>

       <p>The biggest criticism of reenactments <em>is that the emphasis on the military obscures the war’s key issue</em> – <strong>slavery.</strong>  The missing factor in the majority of Civil War reenactments is African Americans. In many communities during the Civil War, black and white populations were roughly equal, but Civil War reenactments are mostly white events.</p> 

       <p>There are a few African American reenactment groups that consider their mission to highlight African American groups who fought for freedom on the Union side. In addition to reenactment, they research the lives of black Civil War soldiers, most of whom were former slaves. Some have found their own ancestors among the nearly 200,000 African Americans who fought for the Union. .</p> 

       <p>As American demographics continue to diversify, <strong>reenacments will continue to play a role in education, tourism and cultural perceptions of citizens.</strong> Despite fears that reenactments that confront slavery will fuel more political strife, reenactors who present on those topics have said that they actually tend to  bring diverse audiences together and spark positive conversations about race. Taken together, they hope that such conversations eventually will produce a more inclusive and honest narrative about some of America's most divisive topics. </p>
